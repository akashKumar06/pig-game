        <strong>
          Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled
          or the player decides to "hold"
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next
            player's turn.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn
            total and the player's turn continues.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their
            score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em><strong>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</strong></em><br> For example, the
          first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could
          hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2,
          and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll
          again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The
          next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-6, after which she
          chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 23 points to her score.
